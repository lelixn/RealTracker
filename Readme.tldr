# RealTracker

**RealTracker** — Real-time / offline point-tracking from video using pseudo-labelled real videos

## 🧠 What is RealTracker

RealTracker is a lightweight point-tracking system for video. It tracks “points” (keypoints / features) across frames — handling visible and occluded points — by leveraging pseudo-labels from unlabeled real videos.  
It draws on the ideas from the “Simpler and Better Point Tracking by Pseudo-Labelling Real Videos” method, aiming to provide robust tracking without requiring large annotated datasets.

## ✅ Features

- Track feature points across frames (online / offline).  
- Works with real-world (un-annotated) videos.  
- Minimal data requirements thanks to pseudo-labeling.  
- Demo / visualisation via simple web interface (Node.js + web UI).  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version X or later)  
- npm (or yarn)  
- A modern browser (for UI)
